My name is Du Man Nguyen. This is the first time my story is published on screen, I hope to inspire and honor those who have had to struggle each day for a chance of a better life in spite of economic setbacks and prejudice.

- Currently, I am a senior International student major in Computer Engineering Technology at Algonquin College.
- I am open to employment after graduation starting May 2021.

### My story

Growing up in Vietnam, I have always wanted to learn in English almost every subjects at school and that is where my interest in Computer Science sprouted and grew. In 2018, I boarded a plane to Canada and here I stay, focus and determined to pursue a career in Computer Engineering while working part-time. I am fortunate to be empowered and supported by my family, my community and kind strangers.
